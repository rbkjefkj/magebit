Hi, this is not 100% done but I'm extremely sick of making it. I hope it proves I can code. Maybe I can finish it if you reallllllly need me to and if you promise to hire me for finishing it. I had a very hard time working so much for free not knowing if it will even lead to anything or if I'm wasting the only life I've got. I've already exceeded every possible deadline and I'm sure we all just want for it to be over.

1) Have a working PHP + MySQL environment on your computer. I used WAMP server.
2) Download this thing
3) Start your server
4) Go to localhost. Importantly, do not specify any port nr
5) The email form should be right there. If you wish to see the database page, go to /test.html

### KNOWN ISSUES
* I didn't put in the success message upon email submit
* Sorting/filtering/searching can't be done simultaneously atm, should write a single DB query for it?
* No hovers on social media buttons
* Error messages on the frontend are unstyled
* PHP files are very messy
* PHP email validation is probably unfinished? Or at least untested
* Maybe test.html has too much JS and too little PHP?! Really only my DB queries use PHP... But I was informed over at StackOverflow that that's how it's supposed to work.

I could obviously fix all these with more time but as I said I'm extremely tired of writing this app.
